# Question 600: Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones
[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-negative-integers-without-consecutive-ones)

## Solution
This is a DP problem.

**Step 1**: build a sequence `f` where `f[k]` indicates the count of binary number without consecutive `1`.

Indeed, `f` is the Fibonacci sequence.
For instance, `f[5]` is the count within `00000` to `11111`, which consists of two following parts:
- `00000` to `01111`; and
- `10000` to `10111`.

Note that numbers start with `11` are invalid.
The first part is `f[4]` and the second part is `f[3]`, thus `f[5] = f[4] + f[3]`.

**Step 2**: go through the digits of the given number from left to right, adds the count in 
corresponding sub-range, until encountered a consecutive `1`.
See the code for details.

Finally, add one to include the number itself.

## Code
#### Java
```java
public class Solution {
    public int findIntegers(int num) {
        // fib[k]: valid counts with length = k
        int[] fib = new int[32];
        fib[0] = 1;
        fib[1] = 2;
        for (int i = 2; i < 32; ++i) fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2];

        List<Integer> digits = new LinkedList<>();
        while (num > 0) {
            digits.add(num % 2);
            num /= 2;
        }

        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = digits.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            ans += digits.get(i) * fib[i];
            if (i == digits.size() - 1 || digits.get(i) == 0 || digits.get(i + 1) == 0) continue;

            --ans;
            break;
        }

        return ans + 1;
    }
}
```
